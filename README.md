Estimation of the Tire Road Friction Coefficient during stationary and slow moving positions

The friction coefficient between a vehicle's tires and the road surface is a crucial parameter influencing vehicle dynamics. Here, I discuss some of findings.

# Tire Contact Patch Normal Force Distribution

The distribution of normal force within the tire's contact patch, \( q_z(x, y) \), is a critical factor in tire modeling. Various pressure distribution models have been proposed to approximate real tire behavior.

In this work, the normal load distribution is derived by specifying individual distributions in the longitudinal (\( q_{zx}(x) \)) and lateral (\( q_{zy}(y) \)) directions, which are then multiplied together:
$$
q_z(x, y) = q_{zx}(x) \cdot q_{zy}(y)
$$
